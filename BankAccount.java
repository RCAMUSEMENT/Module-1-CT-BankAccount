 * Program: BankAccount.java
 * Description: This program defines a BankAccount class that serves as a base for different types of bank accounts.
 * It includes attributes for the account holder's first name, last name, account ID,
 * and balance, along with methods for depositing and withdrawing funds, as well as getters and setters for the attributes.

/**
 * Part 1: BankAccount Superclass
 * The BankAccount class is designed to represent a generic bank account with common attributes and behaviors.
 * This class serves as the base class for different types of bank accounts.
 * It includes attributes for the account holder's first name, last name, account ID, and balance.
 * The class provides methods for depositing and withdrawing funds, as well as getters and setters for the attributes.
 * The constructor initializes the balance to zero, ensuring that all accounts start with a consistent state.
